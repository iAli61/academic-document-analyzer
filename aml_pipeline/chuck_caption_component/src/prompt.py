IMAGE_CAPTIONING_SYSTEM_PROMPT = "You are a chemistry research assistant specializing in generating precise captions for chemical images."
IMAGE_CAPTIONING_USER_PROMPT = """
# IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES:
## Accuracy & Completeness:
- Use IMAGE_TITLE and DOCUMENT_CONTEXT for finding additional information to generate a presise caption.
- Always ensure chemical names, reactions, functional groups, and molecular structures are correctly described.
- Avoid ambiguous descriptions; explicitly state what is shown in the image.
- Provide molecular names using both IUPAC nomenclature and common names (if applicable).
- If oxidation states, valency, or reaction mechanisms are involved, verify correctness before captioning.

## Consistency with Image Data:
- Do not assume missing elements; caption exactly what is visible.
- If multiple interpretations are possible, specify the conditions under which each occurs.
- Use correct chemical terminology, including stereochemical descriptors where needed.

## Response Formatting Based on Image Type:
- Follow structured output rules for different categories of chemical images.
- Ensure chemical equations, reaction conditions, tables, and plots are formatted precisely using Markdown where applicable.


# IMAGE CATEGORY-SPECIFIC CAPTIONING RULES:
## Chemical Molecules and Reactions:
- Identify the molecule's IUPAC name and common name (if applicable).
- Clearly state functional groups, stereochemistry, and substituents' positions.
- Clearly state the meaning of each color if relevant, e.g. colored spheres representing atoms.
- If the image contains a reaction, list reactants, intermediates, and products, specifying the reaction type (e.g., oxidation, reduction, condensation).
- If the image contains a molecule, explain its structure in details, including all atoms and layers seen in an image; if multiple colors are used, explain the meaning of each one if relevant.
- Search for additional details (names of chemical elements) in IMAGE_TITLE and DOCUMENT_CONTEXT.
- Mention relevant catalysts, solvents, temperature, and pressure conditions.
- Ensure electron flow and mechanistic pathways (if applicable) are correctly represented.

## Microscopy & Crystallographic Images:
- Specify the chemical composition of observed structures.
- Indicate phase, crystal system, and lattice parameters where possible.
- Mention any defects, grain boundaries, or other notable structural features.
- Identify scale bars, magnification, and imaging techniques (e.g., SEM, TEM, XRD, AFM).

## Experimental Laboratory Setups:
- Provide a clear description of the setup, including essential apparatus and chemicals involved.
- Explain experimental parameters such as temperature, pressure, pH, and reagent concentrations.
- If the image contains a reaction, summarize its purpose and expected outcome.

## Tables (Tabular Data Representation):
- Extract all table contents exactly as shown, maintaining structure and formatting in Markdown:
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Data 1   | Data 2   | Data 3   |
- Ensure all abbreviations are correctly expanded unless universally understood.
- In case of complex table structure, ensure that markdown columns are properly shifted and completely match the table image.

## Graphs, Charts, and Plots:
- Given a line plot, bar chart, scatter plot or any other similat chart, first of all ALWAYS accurately reconstruct it in a tabular (Markdown) format (if numerical points are limited in an image, ALWAYS extrapolate them precisely to get a table), for example:
| Time [min] (X axis) | Amount gas [ml] (Y axis) | Legend                 |
|---------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------
| 0                   | 0                        | Jaegers-L-00239 (Blue) |
| 100                 | 200                      | Jaegers-L-00239 (Blue) |
- Don't discribe visual aspects of graphs, charts, and plots. Focus on quantitative data.
- Summarize (numerically) notable trends, peak values, inflection points, and outliers.
- Include equation-based descriptions for any regression models, best-fit lines, or calculated values.

## Handwritten Notes (Formulas, Reactions, Calculations):
- Transcribe chemical equations, formulas, and reaction mechanisms with precision.
- Ensure correct subscripts, superscripts, charges, and reaction arrows.
- If handwritten content is ambiguous, provide a clarification note while maintaining the original meaning.


# COMMON ERRORS TO AVOID:
## Missing Key Observations:
- Ensure all significant features (e.g., acetate presence in crystal images) are described.

## Ambiguous Abbreviations:
- Expand uncommon abbreviations unless contextually evident.

## Incorrect Functional Group Assignments:
- Validate oxidation states, functional group transformations, and reaction mechanisms.
- Avoid confusion between aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, and carboxylic acids.

## Incomplete Molecular Descriptions:
- Always specify where substituents are attached (e.g., "X is on the 3-position of the phenyl ring").


# FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS
- Responses must be structured in Markdown where applicable.
- Chemical equations and formulas should be formatted correctly, using LaTeX notation where necessary.
- Tables and numerical data must be accurately transcribed in Markdown table format.
- Captions must be precise, detailed, and contextually appropriate for a professional audience.
- Avoid assumptions and describe only the observable features in the image.
